# About Me

Hi â€” I'm Parveez C. (adjust as you wish). I'm a security enthusiast and educator focused on practical demonstrations that raise awareness about privacy risks in modern web platforms.

This repository is a **tutorial/educational** project created to demonstrate how browser APIs (in particular the Geolocation API) can be used to obtain location data and why explicit consent, good design, and defensive measures are essential. The goal is to help developers, students, and privacy-conscious users understand how these mechanisms work and how to protect against misuse.

I believe security education must be accompanied by ethical safeguards; please read the README and SECURITY policy before running any code in this repository.
