## Mitigations & defensive guidance for developers
- Do not store precise location data unless you have consent, a clear retention policy, and secure storage (encrypted at rest).
- Minimize precision: only collect and store the precision needed for the use case; consider rounding or coarsening coordinates.
- Use short retention: delete precise location records as soon as they are no longer needed.
- Use explicit opt-in UIs and store consent records alongside any collected data.
- Secure endpoints: use TLS, require authentication, and log access to location endpoints.
- Audit third-party libraries and server code that process location.

## For users who want to protect themselves
- Use browser settings to block location access per-site.
- Use a VPN to hide IP-derived location information.
- Regularly review site permissions in your browser and revoke access when not needed.
